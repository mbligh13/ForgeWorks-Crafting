# Sector88-Weapon-Crafting

## Overview
A comprehensive weapon crafting mod that allows players to craft weapons, magazines, and upgrades at workbenches using component parts. All materials must be placed in the workbench inventory to craft items.

## Key Features
- **68+ Recipes**: Craft pistols, SMGs, rifles, snipers, shotguns, magazines, and upgrades
- **Part-Based System**: Requires barrels, receivers, bolts, springs, and metal sheets
- **Tiered Rarity**: From common pistol parts (Tier 1) to ultra-rare .50 BMG components (Tier 8)
- **Breakdown System**: Disassemble weapons back into component parts
- **Simple Crafting**: Place materials in workbench, open GUI, select recipe, craft
