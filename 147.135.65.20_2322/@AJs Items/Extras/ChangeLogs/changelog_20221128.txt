KNOWN ISSUES:
-CDAJ_ADMIN_RED may not actually show up. Its supposed to have a sign above the characters head that says "ADMIN" it still works but I've had a few reports saying its invisible. Unsure what the issue is.
-CDAJ_Trenchcoat varients have poor weighting on the players left leg. I will correct this when I have time.
