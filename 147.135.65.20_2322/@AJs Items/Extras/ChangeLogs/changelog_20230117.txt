FIXES:
-More Damage system floats.

KNOWN ISSUES:
-CDAJ_ADMIN_RED may not actually show up. Its supposed to have a sign above the characters head that says "ADMIN" it still works but I've had a few reports saying its invisible. Unsure what the issue is.
-CDAJ_Trenchcoat varients have poor weighting on the players left leg. I will correct this when I have time.
-CDAJ_MSR_Tan, CDAJ_MSR, have no shot sounds, If you have Morty's Weapons loaded it works. This was a mistake during testing and i will eventually have my own soundsets for this weapon.
-CDAJ_DKS shoots REALLY low and i think i know why, i just havent unfucked it.
